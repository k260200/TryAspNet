# TryAspNet
My first attempt to learn ASP.NET.

I use here MS SQL to store users and their rewards, ADO.NET to get access to data and 
something between 3-layer architecture and MVC to make code more clean.

ASP.NET and HTML/CSS are used to interact with user and allow to use kinda CRUD
operations with data.

I hope you enjoy it!
